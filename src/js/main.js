/*
• put register button back
  o maybe first page should just have two links, one to login.html, one to register.html
• create the reset password controller
• stay signed in over refresh
• make dove img appear over nav li a that is the page currently on
• fix edit data binding
• change h1 font in modal

(check to see if logout is actually un-authorizing)
• can probably put the nav bar on the index.html page then just add an onauth remove class hidden
